# So this is Kagga Pages. 

If you have scrolled here you might be curious about what Kagga pages are - Kagga pages are my ruminations or understandings of a Modern Kannada Epic Poem called [Mankutimmana Kagga](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17936113-mankutimmana-kagga) written by Dr D V Gundappa, first published about 80 years back from today ( 2022 A. D or Krista-Shaka ) .

It is my endeavour to read **One** page every day of this Classic book.
Each page has 5 poem snippets of *4 lines* each.
Most of the Kagga is written in an older style of Kannada

Then I will be writing about it - my understanding of it, in Kannada and also in English. The latter, I found does a good "Is this Understanding right?" test because it is put in another language. 

So, without more ado, onto Kagga. :)
