## So this is Kagga Pages. 

If you have scrolled here you might be curious about what Kagga pages are - Kagga pages are my ruminations or understandings of a Modern Kannada Epic Poem called [Mankutimmana Kagga](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17936113-mankutimmana-kagga) written by Dr D V Gundappa, first published about 80 years back from today.

I hadn't read it before and one of my mother's recent friends kept talking about it - and my mother kept telling me about that - so I figured it would be a good gift. 

Well, it was. 
I am the one reading it now. :)

It is my endeavour to read one page every day - each page has 5 poem snippets of 4 lines each in an older style of Kannada and write about my understanding of that in Kannada and in English - the point of the latter is that translating it into English will inevitably force a deeper understanding of my understanding because I will be doing TiLakaaMaLaka of the topic more than once. 

So, without more ado, onto Kagga. :)


P S : Here's a translated [write-up](https://www.prekshaa.in/article/making-mankutimmana-kagga) on Kagga that introduces the topic of substance to the reader.
